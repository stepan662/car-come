Repository Init Content
=======================

Your project description here.

How to setup locally:

 1. Run jbpm and create new project `car-come`,
 2. Go to project settings and find git url eg. `git://localhost:9418/MySpace/car-come`
 3. Clone this repo (`git clone https://github.com/stepan662/car-come.git`)
 4. Add new remote `git remote add wbadmin <project url>`
 5. Force push changes from this repo to your project `git push wbadmin HEAD -f`
 6. Now you have your repo and two origins - `wbadmin` internal repo of jbpm and `origin`
